You need to develop a reaction timer app to test reaction times and record the fastest. You will need a server that serves up a web page.  Think through how the timer is “fair”. Consider how to deal with someone who rapidly keeps clicking, or uses some other mechanism to “cheat” your system. 

You can use the Messenger system we developed in class as a starting point. 

I suggest you start with a system like the one below with one button that changes color after some random time between 1 and 20 seconds. Think through how you will transmit the timing from the web page to the server and record it there.
